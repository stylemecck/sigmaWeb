    </p>
    <p class="para1">I can't believe that after three long years of being apart, we will finally be able to meet in person. I am counting down the days until I can hold you in my arms and look into your beautiful eyes.</p>
    <p class="para1">You are my everything, my rock, my partner in crime. I love you more than words can express and I can't wait to show you just how much you mean to me.</p>
    <p class="para1">I know we have had our ups and downs, but our love has only grown stronger with each passing day. I am so grateful to have you as my wife and I promise to cherish and love you for the rest of my days.</p>
    <p class="para1">I can't wait to make new memories with you and laugh until our stomachs hurt. You bring so much joy and light into my life and I am beyond blessed to have you by my side.</p>
    <p class="para1">I love you more than words can say, Swetanjali. Here's to many more years of love, laughter, and happiness together.</p>
    <p class="para1">Forever and always,</p>
